the merely possible) and though, for him. the divine causality proceeds by way
of science, Ulrich expressly reiects a notion of creation that would come about
through a necessary emanation. The origin of creaturos is explained by a free
creation from nothing.

The divine intellect is also identified with the divine truth, which creatures
imitate and mirror in their own way. Things are true in that they exist and
operate in accord with what has been ordained in the divine art. Hence. the
divine exemplars furnish a stable and rational foundation for things without
depriving them of the truth and reality proper to their own being. Truth
essentially is one, because the divine art is one: but insosar as creatures imitate
it diversely, through participation in it, truth is multiplied.

That there are ideas in God Ulrich proves by arguing that every artist who
operates in view of an end must have the form of his work in his intellect. Since
the First Cause works in this way, He must have within Himself the forms of
things to be created. These forms are the ideas. The divine idea is defined as
the divine essence known as imitable‚ more strictly. it is a model in accord with
which things have been, or are to be, made. Thus, sor Ulrich the ideas are
completely practical. Here we have sufficient ground to distinguish what is in the
divine intellect as idea from what is there simply as known. God knows more
than He createS, but He creates only that os which He has an idea. The idea,
in other words, is a causal principle, and not a cognoscitive one. Insofar as it
may be considered cognoscitive, it is to be understood as that whereby only that
which is to be created is known.

The idea is one with the divine essence; it is regarded as multiple only by
reason of God1s knowledge of the diverse imitability os the divine essence. The
real relations of creatures to the divine essence and the conceptual relation of

“ that-essence to creatures enable us to recognize a multiplicity of ideas. Yet,

strictly, according to Ulrich, it is more correct to speak of the idea of many
things than of many ideas.

In general, whatever exists as a distinct effect has an idea in God. Ulrich
posits, therefore, ideas of individuals and of accidents, as well as ideas of the
various species. So, too, since prime matter has an essence of its own, apart
'from prime form, there is a proper idea of it; more correctly, however, its idea
is that of the composite in which it exists. Finaliy, there is an idea of material
privation, insofar as this is found in a real being; formal privation, as a complete
negation, has no idea in the divine mind.

Because the ultimate foundation of the created order rests on the divine
ideas, Ulrich finds an intimate connection between creature and creator: so much
so that God is said by him to be the immediate cause of the being and of each
operation of the creature. Yet, besides the divine immediate causality‚ Ulrich
Α also admits a creaturely immediate causality‚ since the two belong to different
orders. The first emphasizes an ultimate foundation and the fact that God is
not obliged to work through secondary causes, The second is immediate as
flowing from the principles of a nature, but it is nonetheless a derived power,
because it depends on a being other than itself.

Since the operation of God within things is viewed in the light of the act of
conservation, God is said to be in loco, not circumscriptively nor diffinitively,
but only causally. His conservative causality, considered as the ordering ot'
things made, is providence. Just as creatures are formed by an idea proper to
each, so does providence lead these created natures to ends congruent to each.
Because providence rules all things, chance and fortune cannot function as
efficient causeS‚ but only as accidental effects arising from the conjunction of
ends intended in themselves. The consequent optimism os Ulrich is embodied
in the view that all the events of lise, good or seemingly bad, are ultimately
ordered to the good.
