THESIS

THE DOCTRINE OF THE DIVINE IDEAS 1121
SUMMA DE BONO OF ULRICH OF STRASB
TEXT AND PHILOSOPHICAL INTRODUCT

(Abstract)

Ulrich os Strasbourg was a German Dominican of the thirteemjssv⁸
a pupil and disciple of St. Albert the Great. He entered the Do ⁶*
in Strasbourg at an early age, and followed the lectures of St. Albe . .
from 1248-1252. He was provincial prefect of the German provi}
Order from 1272- 1277, when he was sent to Parisvto lecture on the:
Peter Lonibard. He died there' 111 the same year, before attaining to· ,ιζ
tracy. 1· -·
His principal, and indeed only extant, work' 15 the De Summo s
sophico· theological treatise on questions and problems current in the„
of thirteenth century masters. Because this work is for the most·
manuscript, it was necessary to edit the fifth tractate of Book HF*
study the doctrine οἱ the divine ideas 111 his philosophy. The p -ς
the Summa De Bono II, 5, rests on photostatic copies of five 'ava
scripts. Os these, Paris 15900 has been chosen as basic. ιλ.
The central philosophical problem of the thesis revolves around s?
of the divine ideas as understood to be the essence of God known 3 ¹
⁵ the creature. Ulrich' s treatment of this problem lends itself to 3 s·
three headings· (1) intellectual operations in God, with special 18111118
0311531 activity of the divine knowledge, (2) the definition and c1‘1-
divine ideas, their multiplicity‚ and their ultimate referenoe; (3)
consequences of the doctrine of ideas, particularly the mode of God <
to things, His providence and His prescience. · ‚j
The De Summo Bono, as Ulrich himself indicates, is a work de
exposition of the Supreme Good. Within that general framewor
book is concerned' with the essence of God, and those things conseq
Historians have quite correctly called this book a kind of a 00111111811κ

expounds the signification of the names that express the intellectu⁷ ε
of God. Thus the divine 111835, conceived as causal principles, bel·
